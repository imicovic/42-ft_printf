# Welcome to 42-ft_printf project

The project is pretty self-explanatory. It's goal is to recreate printf function. ft_printf function supports printing strings, characters, pointers, integers, unsigned integers and hexadecimal numbers.

## Usage
After creating main function in a my_program.c file run

```bash
make
cc my_program.c -L. -lftprintf -o my_program
```

The goal of the project was to introduce us to the variadic functions and improve problem solving abilities and string manipulation skills.
